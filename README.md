## Business Introduction
PowerCharge Utilities is a prominent electric utility provider operating in a dynamic and evolving
energy landscape. The company's primary mission is to ensure the reliable delivery of electrical 
power to millions of customers across urban and suburban areas. PowerCharge Utilities has 
established itself as a key player in the energy sector, focusing on sustainability and adapting to 
emerging technologies. The energy sector has witnessed a significant transformation in recent 
years driven by environmental concerns, regulatory changes, and technological advancements. 
One of the most notable developments has been the rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) as 
part of global efforts to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change.

## Business Problem
PowerCharge Utilities encounters several critical challenges due to the growing adoption of 
electric veicies.
1. Increased Load Demand: Widespread EV adoption has caused a significant spike in 
electricity demand, particularly during peak charging times. This strains the existing 
distribution network infrastructure.
2. Grid Overloads: Frequent overloads in the distribution network leads to voltage 
fluctuations and outages in specific areas, affecting overall grid reliability.
3. Customer Satisfaction: EV owners expect reliable and convenient charging services. 
Ensuring this level of service is essential to maintaining customer satisfaction and 
loyalty.
4. Cost Management: Balancing increased load demands and grid reliability comes at a 
significant cost. PowerCharge Utilities must optimize network investments to manage 
expenses effectively.

## Rationale for the Project
Distribution Network Analysis in the energy industry refers to the process of studying and 
evaluating the electrical distribution networks that deliver electricity from high-voltage 
transmission lines to end-users, such as homes, businesses, and industrial facilities.

This analysis becomes even more critical with the rise of EVs, as it transforms the energy 
landscape.

Top Five Reasons for the Project's Significance:
1. Customer Retention: Maintaining a reliable EV charging experience is essential for 
retaining existing customers who have embraced EVs.
2. Revenue Growth: Accommodating the growing demand for EV charging services opens 
new revenue streams and capitalizes on the expanding EV market.
3. Sustainability Goals: Supporting EVs aligns with the company's sustainability objectives, 
contributing to reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
4. Regulatory Compliance: Meeting regulatory standards for grid reliability and capacity 
planning is vital to avoid penalties and ensure operational excellence.
5. Technological Innovation: Embracing data analytics empowers PowerCharge Utilities to 
stay at the forefront of technological innovation in the energy sector.

## Aim of the Project
The project aims to achieve the following objectives:
1. Assess Network Capacity: Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the distribution 
network's current capacity to handle increased load from EV charging stations.
2. Identify Bottlenecks: Identify potential bottlenecks and vulnerabilities within the 
distribution network that could hinder reliable electricity delivery to EV charging stations.
3. Optimize Network Upgrades: Develop a data-driven strategy for network upgrades that 
maximizes efficiency, minimizes costs, and ensures grid reliability.
